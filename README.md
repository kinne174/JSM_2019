This work is a preliminary exploration into using Graph Neural Networks [1] as a knowledge base
to condense and store relevant information from a large corpus such as a textbook. Then take that
knowledge base and query it to answer questions. The testing resources used are from the 
[AI2 Reasoning Challenge](http://data.allenai.org/arc/) (ARC) who have provided a corpus (~14 
million sentence) and multiple choice questions from standardized tests given to students at a
4th grade science level. 

## Libraries used
1. pytorch 1.1.0
2. dgl 0.2
